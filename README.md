## What's on my mind ðŸŒ±

Hey peeps, my name is David Oti ( AKA Davmixcool ). I am a tech advocate, software engineer, technical writer, and fitness trainer. I love building tools and software that helps businesses and people grow/scale smartly. I love UI/UX implementations as well as frontend and backend integrations. Aside from work, I spend most of my time in RND and also contributing to the open-source community.  

Recently, I tried setting up my workspace to boost productivity and also to help me start a vlog about tech-lifestyle related things. So far so good I have made some progress on my workspace which I will be sharing with you all soon.
